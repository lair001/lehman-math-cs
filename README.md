# Solutions for Mathematics for Computer Science by Lehman, Leighton and Meyer
Solutions for the June 6, 2018 edition of *Mathematics for Computer Science* by Lehman, Leighton and Meyer and its corresponding [course](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:OCW+6.042J+2T2019/about) on MIT Open Library.
